<h2>Questions list</h2>

<hr>

<p>1. My first impression of the site was it has a nice simple layout with links that help guide you to things that you are looking for. 
    For example: Products, Discover, Recipes, and a Search entry. 
</p>

2. How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)

<p>2. The site is oraganized with some links on the left hand side with a search entry on the top of the site.</p>

3. Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?
<p>3. The structure makes sense overall. But the main page to the site seems to be cluttered with a lot of stuff as you
    scroll through it. 
</p>

4. Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it? Why?
<p>4. I like the graphics in the site because the a fairly simple. Plus each one has something to do with the link it is attached to.</p>

5. How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
reasonable?
<p>5. The load time for the website was fairly quick. I didn't have any problems loading it up and viewing it.</p>

6. Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?
<p>6. There is not to much color in the site other than the logo being red. But text is very readable and not hard to understand.
    I also liked that the website had pictures of the food so you know what it looks like before you buy it.
    It also makes it more enticing to buy with the pictures. 
</p>

7. Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
navigation well done?
<p>7. I liked how the page navigation was. It was easy to just click on the search bar and look things up that way.
    You could as well click on the different links in the website. They made them look like they were on a bookmark so it was easier to looke and click on.
</p>

8. Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?
<p>8. The page is formatted the same however the different links have their own unique design to them with different graphics.
    The color scheme was pretty uniform throughout the website. 
</p>

9. How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?
<p>9. The webpage worked well and was well formatted for my phone and laptop screens. With my Iphone it couln't fit all the information on the main page.
    because it was condensed to my phone but everything was still readable and accessible. Along with all the links working too.  
</p>

10. What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?
Procedure:
<p>10. I thought that the implementation of the recipes catergory was something unique. Most grocey store websites simply have the food.
    But this one offered recipes that you can cook from and with there products without having to go to another store.
